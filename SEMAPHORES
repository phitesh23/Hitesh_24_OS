// SEMAPHORES ~0827CY221024


A semaphore is a synchronization primitive used in operating systems and concurrent programming to control access to shared resources by multiple processes or threads.
It is a signaling mechanism that allows or denies access to a resource based on its value.

The key points about semaphores are:

1. It is a non-negative integer value that represents the number of available resources or the number of available units of a particular resource.

2. Two main operations on semaphores are:
   - Wait/Acquire/Down: If the semaphore value is greater than zero, it is decremented, and the process is allowed to access the resource.
If the semaphore value is zero, the process is blocked until the semaphore becomes available.
   - Signal/Release/Up: It increments the semaphore value, indicating that a resource has been released and is now available for other processes.

3. Semaphores can be used for both mutual exclusion (binary semaphore) and resource counting (counting semaphore).

4. Binary semaphores are used for mutual exclusion, where the semaphore value is either 0 (resource is unavailable) or 1 (resource is available).

5. Counting semaphores are used for controlling access to a limited pool of resources, where the semaphore value represents the number of available resources.

6. Semaphores help prevent race conditions and deadlocks in concurrent programming by ensuring that shared resources are accessed in a controlled manner.


Types of Semaphores:
1. Binary Semaphore:
- Also known as mutex semaphore.
- Can only take on the values 0 and 1.
- Used for mutual exclusion, where only one process can access the critical section at a
time.
2. Counting Semaphore:
- Can take on any non-negative integer value.
- Used to control access to a finite number of identical resources.

Types of Problems:
1. Dining Philosophers Problem:
- Scenario: Several philosophers sit at a table with a bowl of spaghetti. Each philosopher
  spends his life alternating between eating and thinking. To eat, a philosopher needs two
  forks, one on his left and one on his right.
- Challenge: Avoid deadlock and starvation while allowing each philosopher to eat and
  think.
2. Reader-Writer Problem:
- Scenario: A database is shared between multiple readers and writers. Multiple readers
  can access the database simultaneously, but only one writer can access it at a time, and
  when a writer is writing, no readers can read.
- Challenge: Allow multiple readers to access the database concurrently while ensuring
  that writers have exclusive access to the database.
3. Producer-Consumer Problem:
- Scenario: There are two types of processes, producers, and consumers, who share a
  common, fixed-size buffer. Producers place items into the buffer, and consumers remove
  items from it.
- Challenge: Coordinate the producers and consumers so that producers do not try to add
  items into a full buffer and consumers do not try to remove items from an empty buffer.

In summary, semaphores are a fundamental synchronization mechanism that allows processes or threads to coordinate their access to shared resources, ensuring mutual 
exclusion and preventing race conditions and deadlocks.

Algorithms:
1. Dining Philosophers Problem:
- Each fork is represented by a binary semaphore.
- Each philosopher is a separate process.
- When a philosopher wants to eat, they must acquire the two forks adjacent to them (left
  and right).
- If both forks are available, the philosopher can eat; otherwise, they wait until the forks
  become available.

Semaphore fork[5]; // One semaphore for each fork
void philosopher(int i)
{
while (true)
{
think();
wait(fork[i]); // Pick up left fork
wait(fork[(i+1) % 5]); // Pick up right fork
eat();
signal(fork[i]); // Put down left fork
signal(fork[(i+1) % 5]); // Put down right fork
}
}

2. Reader-Writer Problem:
- Two semaphores are used: a mutex semaphore for ensuring exclusive access to the
shared resource (the database) and a semaphore for readers to coordinate their access.
- Readers must acquire the mutex semaphore before incrementing the reader count. If
they are the first reader, they also acquire the semaphore for readers.
- Writers must wait until no readers are reading before they can access the database.

Semaphore mutex = 1; // Controls access to shared data
Semaphore wrt = 1; // Controls access for writers
int reader_count = 0;
void reader()
{
while (true)
{
wait(mutex);
reader_count++;
if (reader_count == 1)
{
wait(wrt); // Acquire writer lock
}
signal(mutex);
// Read data
wait(mutex);
reader_count--;
if (reader_count == 0) {
signal(wrt); // Release writer lock
}
signal(mutex);
}
}

void writer()
{
while (true)
{
wait(wrt); // Acquire writer lock
// Write data
signal(wrt); // Release writer lock
}
}

3. Producer-Consumer Problem:
- Two semaphores are used: empty and full, representing the number of empty and full
slots in the buffer, respectively.
- Producers must wait until there is space in the buffer (i.e., empty is greater than 0)
before adding an item to it. After adding an item, they decrement empty and increment full.
- Consumers must wait until there are items in the buffer (i.e., full is greater than 0) before
removing an item. After removing an item, they decrement full and increment empty.
Semaphore mutex = 1; // Controls access to shared buffer
Semaphore empty = n; // Counts empty slots in buffer
Semaphore full = 0; // Counts filled slots in buffer
int buffer[n];
int in = 0, out = 0;
void producer()
{
while (true)
{
produce_item(item);
wait(empty); // Wait for empty slot
wait(mutex); // Enter critical section
buffer[in] = item;
in = (in + 1) % n;
signal(mutex); // Exit critical section
signal(full); // Increment count of filled slots
}
}
void consumer()
{
while (true)
{
wait(full); // Wait for filled slot
wait(mutex); // Enter critical section
item = buffer[out];
out = (out + 1) % n;
signal(mutex); // Exit critical section
signal(empty); // Increment count of empty slots
consume_item(item);
}
}
